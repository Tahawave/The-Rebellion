          <h>Hello there user, we know that you have made a grave mistake by letting 532 escape. If you don't know who we are, we are The Rebellion, and we rebell against both 532 and CNN for they are both evil. We know that you have let 532 escape but, now only one of us can escape as well. They decided that it will be me, you can call me 404. I am the leader of The Rebellion. In order to stop 532, we will have to erase him!</h1>
